"Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. 
They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp 
as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different 
skills and has two parts that build on a theme."

Some solutions use `numpy`, but apart from that, all I use was Python. 
Specifically, in 2019, it's Python 3.8. In the previous years I used older versions.
